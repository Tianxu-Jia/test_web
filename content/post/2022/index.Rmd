In this article, we first analyze the limitations of the generic churn model through an user case story, based on that the churn model and marketing intervention system is proposed. This system not only forescast the churn of coustomer, the most importantly, it can provide the solution of how to intervene the coustomer and retain the costomer. After all, retaining customers and creating market value at a reasonable cost is one of the most important purposes of building a churn model. In the second part, we analyze all the challenges in building a customer churn and how to find the optimal intervention action. In the last part, the solutions to these challenges are given out.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```
